## What is the purpose of the module

This module serves as a simple checker of prerequisites that usage of `@LRA` mandates.
As example we can say that class annotated with `@LRA` is expected to contains annotations
`@Status`, `@Compensate` and `@Complete`. All of this method needs to define `@Path` annotation etc.

### Usage

Only add the dependency to this project to your project. Then during the container startup
(the term container here invoves e.g. instance of WildFly Swarm too) there is loaded
a CDI extension which throws `DeploymentException` with description of the issue.

The coordinates of this artifact are

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jboss.narayana.rts</groupId>
  <artifactId>lra-cdi-rest</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
